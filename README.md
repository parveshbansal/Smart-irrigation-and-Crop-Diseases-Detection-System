# Smart-irrigation-and-Crop-Diseases-Detection-System
This project encompasses a solution to issues like slow plant growth, improper irrigation, reasons for cause of diseases in plant and their remedies. It takes several parameters into account like soil moisture, future weather conditions, irrigation schedules, etc. to determine the optimum time to irrigate fields. It is currently working for nine different types of crops. This system is also capable of identifying the cause and type of disease affecting the proper growth of a plant by taking images of leaves of the plant as input. This project was presented at AIRC'19, IIT-Bombay(secured ninth position)
