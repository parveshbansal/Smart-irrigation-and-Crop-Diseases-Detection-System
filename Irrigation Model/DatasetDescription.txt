3. Past Usage:
	Dataset was used in All India Research Championship(AIRC) at (IIT Bombay)
4. Relevant Information Paragraph:

   Dataset can be used to train the Machine Learning model which will
   predict whether irrigation is required or not based on the values 
   of 5 parametrs.  

   From the original data examples with missing values were removed (the
   majority having the predicted value missing), and the ranges of the
   continuous values have been scaled.
6. Number of Attributes: 6

7. Attribute information:
	Given is the attribute name, attribute type, the measurement unit and a
   brief description.  The number of class is the value to predict: either
   as a continuous value or as a classification problem.

	Name		Data Type	Meas.	Description
	----		---------	-----	-----------
	CropType	nominal			fixed Numeric values (1->Wheat blow is for all)
	CropDays	nominal			Days passed after sowing crop
	SoilMoisture	continuous	DHT11	Soil Moisture , Can be read by soil moisture sensor
	temperature	continuous	°C	perpendicular to length
	Humidity	continuous	%	with meat in shell
	Y (class)	Binary			1 for Irrigation required 0 for not
